1.1 Array Formulas
Array formulas are powerful formulas that can perform multiple calculations in one formula. They can return multiple results or work across ranges of data.
•	How to Enter an Array Formula:
  Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter after typing the formula (instead of just Enter).
•	Example:
  o	=SUM(A1:A10*B1:B10) – This multiplies corresponding values in the range A1:A10 and B1:B10 and then sums them.
  o	This can be written as an array formula: =SUM(A1:A10*B1:B10) and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter.

1.2 Nested Functions
Using functions inside other functions is a powerful way to solve complex problems.
•	Example:
  =IF(AND(A1 > 10, B1 < 5), "Yes", "No")
  This uses AND within an IF function to check multiple conditions.

1.3 Advanced Text Functions
•	TEXTJOIN: Combines multiple text values, separated by a delimiter.
  =TEXTJOIN(",", TRUE, A1:A5) combines the values in A1:A5 with commas in between.

•	SEARCH and FIND: These functions are used to search for specific substrings within text.
  o	=SEARCH("apple", A1) returns the position of "apple" in A1.

•	LEFT, MID, RIGHT: Used to extract specific parts of text:
  o	=LEFT(A1, 5) returns the first 5 characters of text in A1.
  o	=MID(A1, 3, 5) extracts 5 characters starting from the 3rd character.

1.4 Advanced Lookup Functions
•	INDEX & MATCH: More powerful and flexible than VLOOKUP.
  Example: =INDEX(A1:A10, MATCH(B1, B1:B10, 0)) – This looks for the value in B1 in the range B1:B10 and returns the corresponding value from A1:A10.

•	INDEX & MATCH for Two-Dimensional Lookup:
  =INDEX(A1:D10, MATCH(B1, A1:A10, 0), MATCH(C1, A1:D1, 0))
  This searches for a value in both a row and column.
