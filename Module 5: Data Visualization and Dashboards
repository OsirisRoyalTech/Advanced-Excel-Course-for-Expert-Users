5.1 Advanced Charting Techniques
Excel offers many options for visualizing complex data beyond the basic charts:
•	Combo Charts: Combine different types of charts (e.g., line and column) to display multiple data series in one chart.
•	Sparkline Charts: Small, cell-sized charts within a row or column that give a visual representation of trends.
•	Dynamic Charts: Use named ranges or dynamic data validation lists to make charts update automatically based on user input.

5.2 Creating Dashboards
A dashboard aggregates multiple types of data and presents it in a visually accessible format. Here are key elements:
•	Use PivotTables and PivotCharts for quick summarization.
•	Slicers: Use slicers for interactive filtering of data.
•	Conditional Formatting: Apply color coding or data bars for better visualization of key metrics.
•	Forms: Create interactive forms and controls (like drop-down lists) that allow users to interact with the dashboard.

5.3 Using Power BI with Excel
Power BI is a business intelligence tool that integrates well with Excel. It allows you to create complex reports and dashboards that update in real time. 
You can pull in data from Excel, create models, and share interactive visualizations.
