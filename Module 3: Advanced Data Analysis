3.1 Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts
Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts are essential for summarizing and analyzing large datasets.
•	Advanced Pivot Table Features: 
  o	Multiple Consolidation Ranges: Combine multiple data sources into one Pivot Table.
  o	Calculated Fields: Create custom calculations within a Pivot Table.
Example:
  =Sales - Costs could be a calculated field showing profit.
•	Group Data:
  Group data by date, category, etc., for better analysis. Example: Right-click a date field and choose Group to group data by months or years.

3.2 Scenario Analysis and Data Tables
•	What-If Analysis: Excel offers tools to perform scenario analysis. 
  o	Data Tables: Create one-variable and two-variable data tables to see how changing input values affects the result.
  o	Scenario Manager: Allows you to define different input scenarios (like best case, worst case, etc.) and see how they affect the outcome.

3.3 Solver Add-in
Solver is used to find optimal solutions for problems with constraints, such as maximizing profits or minimizing costs.
•	Example:
  You have a production process and want to maximize profit while staying within the limits of material resources. Solver helps you determine the best mix 
  of products to produce.

3.4 Statistical Functions
Excel includes many statistical functions for deep analysis, such as:
•	CORREL: Measures the correlation between two sets of data.
•	LINEST: Performs linear regression analysis on data.
•	FORECAST: Predicts future values based on existing data.
