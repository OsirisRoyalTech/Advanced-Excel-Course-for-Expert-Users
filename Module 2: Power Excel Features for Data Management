2.1 Power Query
Power Query is a tool used for importing, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data from various sources. It is ideal for automating repetitive data extraction tasks.
•	Loading Data: Use Data > Get & Transform Data to import data from sources such as databases, web, Excel files, and more.
•	Transforming Data: You can filter, merge, split, and transform data using the Power Query Editor.
•	Example:
  o	Combine data from multiple sheets or files into one dataset.
  o	Clean data by removing duplicates or irrelevant columns, changing data types, etc.

2.2 Power Pivot
Power Pivot extends Excel’s capabilities to create sophisticated data models. It allows you to import large datasets, create relationships, and use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to build powerful calculations.
•	Creating Data Models:
  Power Pivot allows you to load data from multiple tables and create relationships between them.

•	Example:
  o	Load sales data and product data, then create a relationship between product IDs to analyze total sales by product.

•	Using DAX:
DAX functions allow for advanced calculations such as:
  o	SUMX: Sum of an expression over a table.
  o	CALCULATE: Used to evaluate an expression in a modified filter context.
Example:
  =CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[Region] = "North")
